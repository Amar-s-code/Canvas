        <h3>Leetcode june challenge problem 3 <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/539/week-1-june-1st-june-7th/3349/">Two City Scheduling</a></h3>
        <p>
            There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the i-th person to city A is costs[i][0], and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is costs[i][1].

            Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N people arrive in each city.
            <p>
            <b>Note:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>1 <= costs.length <= 100</li>
                <li>It is guaranteed that costs.length is even.</li>
                <li>1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000</li>

            <h4>Approach:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We can think of picking values from two corresponding lists with two conditions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>we need to pick half the elements for the sum from one and the other half from the other list</li>
                        <li>if an element is picked from one of the lists then we cannot pick the element at the corresponding position from the other list</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Here the two lists are provided such that they're in a list of lists where the internal list contains the elements from both the lists at a 
                    particular position.</li>
                <li>So lets sort the 'costs' list using with the difference between the corresponding elements of the two lists and place them in descending order</li>   
                <li>We need to keep of the elements added to the minimum value from the lists,let's name the lists as 'a' and 'b' to keep track of indices</li> 
                <li>We will just iterate through the sorted costs list fetching the minimum and updating the corresponding indices 'a' or 'b' as we go along</li> 
                <li>When we had reached the selecting the possible minimum elements from either of the lists be it 'a' or 'b' we'll just have to pick the rest from 
                    the other element
                </li>
